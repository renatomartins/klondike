# Klondike

A simple web-based patience card game.
It helped me learn a bit about, like:

 * native HTML5 drag & drop;
 * flexbox;
 * viewport lengths.


## TODO

 * improve the css measures and colors
 * deal 1 or 3 cards from the deck
 * keyboard shortcuts


## Contribute

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Compile files into `dist` folder:

```
$ grunt
```

There is a `watch` task that compile every time a file is saved:

```
$ grunt watch
```
