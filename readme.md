# Klondike

A patience card game to play in the browser. :hearts:

Drag & drop the cards to move them between piles and double-click to move to the foundations. Read the rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_%28solitaire%29#Rules).

### Some of the stuff inside (and around):

 * Grunt
 * Backbone
 * LESS
 * native HTML5 drag & drop
 * localStorage
 * flexbox
 * font icons
 * viewport length units

### Browser support

Based on [caniuse.com](caniuse.com):

 * IE 10
 * Firefox 33
 * Chrome 34
 * Safari 7.1
 * Opera 26
 * Android Browser 4.4


## TODO

 * tests please!
 * move cards with single clicks
 * make it extensible to support other solitaire games
 * keyboard shortcuts & ARIA


## Contribute

Requirements:

 * Node.js
 * Grunt (`npm install -g grunt-cli`)
 * Bower (`npm install -g bower`)

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Compile the source files:

```
$ grunt
```

There is a `watch` task that compiles every time a file is saved:

```
$ grunt watch
```

Now you can open `dist/index.html` in your browser.


You can also fill an issue, ideas or pull requests.
