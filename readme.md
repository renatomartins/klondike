# Klondike

A patience card game to play in the browser. :hearts:

_Tip: a narrower screen will look better, for now._

### Some of the stuff inside (and around):

 * Grunt
 * Backbone
 * Require.js
 * LESS
 * native HTML5 drag & drop
 * flexbox
 * font icons by icomoon
 * viewport length units


## TODO

 * improve the css measures
 * deal 1 or 3 cards from the deck
 * tests please!
 * make it extensible to support other solitaire games
 * keyboard shortcuts


## Contribute

Requirements:

 * Node.js
 * Grunt (`npm install -g grunt-cli`)

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Compile the source files:

```
$ grunt
```

There is a `watch` task that compiles every time a file is saved:

```
$ grunt watch
```

Now you can open `dist/index.html` in your browser.


You can also fill an issue, ideas or pull requests.
